## What is Memos?

Memos is a privacy-first, self-hosted knowledge base for personal notes, team wikis, and knowledge management. Built with Go and React, it runs as a single binary with minimal resource usage.

Whether you're capturing quick thoughts, building a personal knowledge base, or sharing information with your team, Memos provides a clean, distraction-free environment for your content.

## Architecture Overview

Memos is built with modern technologies designed for performance and maintainability:

└── auth_service.proto   # Authentication

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  **Dual Protocol Design**: Memos uses Connect RPC for browser clients and gRPC-Gateway for REST compatibility, giving you type-safe APIs and HTTP/JSON support.

## Core Concepts

### Memos

A memo is a piece of content written in Markdown. Each memo has:

- **Content**: Rich markdown with support for code blocks, tables, task lists, and more
- **Visibility**: `PUBLIC` (anyone can view), `PROTECTED` (logged-in users), or `PRIVATE` (only you)
- **Tags**: Automatically extracted from `#hashtags` in your content
- **Attachments**: Images, videos, and files stored locally or in S3
- **Relations**: Link memos together for knowledge graphs
- **Properties**: Computed metadata (has links, has tasks, has code blocks)

### Users & Authentication

Memos supports multiple authentication methods:

- **Password-based auth** with secure JWT access tokens (15-min expiration)
- **Personal Access Tokens (PAT)** for API access and long-lived sessions
- **SSO providers** via identity providers (OAuth2/OIDC)

The first user created automatically becomes an **admin** with full system access.

### Storage Options

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="SQLite">
    **Default and recommended** for most users:
    - Zero configuration
    - Single file database
    - Perfect for < 10,000 memos
    - Automatic backups via file copy
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="MySQL">
    For larger deployments:
    - Better concurrent write performance
    - Familiar replication/backup tools
    - Use when you need multi-server setup
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="PostgreSQL">
    Enterprise-grade option:
    - Advanced indexing capabilities
    - JSON query support
    - Robust ecosystem
