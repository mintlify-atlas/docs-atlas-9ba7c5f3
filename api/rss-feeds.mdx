Memos provides built-in RSS feed generation for public content, allowing users to subscribe to memos using any RSS reader.

## Available Feeds

Memos automatically generates RSS feeds for public content:

### Explore Feed

Public memos from all users on the instance:

```
https://your-memos.com/explore/rss.xml
```

### User Feed

Public memos from a specific user:

```
https://your-memos.com/u/{username}/rss.xml
```

<Note>
Only memos with `PUBLIC` visibility are included in RSS feeds. Private and protected memos are automatically excluded.
</Note>

## Feed Format

Memos generates RSS 2.0 compliant feeds using the [gorilla/feeds](https://github.com/gorilla/feeds) library.

### Feed Structure

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rss version="2.0" xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/">
  <channel>
    <title>Memos</title>
    <link>https://your-memos.com</link>
    <description>An open source, lightweight note-taking service.</description>
    <language>en-us</language>
    <pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2026 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
    
    <item>
      <title>My First Memo</title>
      <link>https://your-memos.com/memos/abc123</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my memo content&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This is my memo content&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
      <author>user@example.com (John Doe)</author>
      <guid>https://your-memos.com/memos/abc123</guid>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2026 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <enclosure url="https://your-memos.com/file/attachments/xyz789/image.jpg" 
                 length="102400" 
                 type="image/jpeg" />
    </item>
  </channel>
</rss>
```

## Feed Item Details

### Title Generation

Memos automatically generates item titles from memo content:

1. Extracts the first line of the memo
2. Removes markdown heading syntax (`#`, `##`, etc.)
3. Truncates to 100 characters at word boundary
4. Adds ellipsis (`...`) if truncated
5. Falls back to "Memo" if empty

**Examples:**

| Memo Content | Generated Title |
|--------------|----------------|
| `# Hello World\n\nThis is content` | `Hello World` |
| `This is a memo` | `This is a memo` |
| `A very long title that exceeds one hundred characters and needs to be truncated...` | `A very long title that exceeds one hundred characters and needs to be truncated...` |
| *(empty)* | `Memo` |

### Content Rendering

Memo content is rendered as HTML using the markdown service:

- Markdown is converted to HTML
- Both `<description>` and `<content:encoded>` contain the full HTML
- Inline styles and formatting are preserved
- Code blocks are rendered with proper formatting

### Author Information

Each feed item includes author details:

```xml
<author>user@example.com (Display Name)</author>
```

- Uses the user's display name or username as fallback
- Includes email address if available
- In explore feeds, each item shows its respective author
- In user feeds, all items share the same author

### Attachments as Enclosures

The first attachment of a memo is included as an RSS enclosure:

```xml
<enclosure url="https://your-memos.com/file/attachments/xyz789/image.jpg" 
           length="102400" 
           type="image/jpeg" />
```

**Enclosure URL by storage type:**

- **Local storage**: `{baseURL}/file/attachments/{uid}/{filename}`
- **External storage**: Direct reference URL
- **S3 storage**: Direct reference URL (presigned if configured)

<Info>
Only the first attachment is included in the RSS enclosure. To access all attachments, users must visit the memo's web page.
</Info>

## Caching and Performance

### Server-Side Caching

RSS feeds are cached to improve performance:

- **Cache duration**: 1 hour (3600 seconds)
- **Maximum cache size**: 50 feeds
- **Eviction policy**: Least Recently Used (LRU)
- **Cache keys**: `explore` and `user:{username}`

### HTTP Caching Headers

Feeds include standard HTTP caching headers:

```http
Content-Type: application/rss+xml; charset=utf-8
Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600
ETag: "a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8"
Last-Modified: Fri, 28 Feb 2026 10:00:00 GMT
```

### Conditional Requests

RSS readers can use `If-None-Match` for efficient polling:

**Request:**

```http
GET /explore/rss.xml HTTP/1.1
Host: your-memos.com
If-None-Match: "a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8"
```

**Response (if unchanged):**

```http
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
```

**Response (if changed):**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
ETag: "b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9"
Content-Type: application/rss+xml; charset=utf-8

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
...
```

## Feed Limits

To maintain performance and reasonable feed sizes:

- **Maximum items per feed**: 100 memos
- **Ordering**: Most recently updated first
- **Visibility**: Only `PUBLIC` memos are included
- **Status**: Only `NORMAL` (non-archived) memos are included

## Custom Feed Configuration

Feed metadata can be customized via instance settings:

```bash
# Default feed information
Title: "Memos"
Description: "An open source, lightweight note-taking service. Easily capture and share your great thoughts."
Language: "en-us"
```

To customize via the API:

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://your-memos.com/api/v1/instance/settings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customProfile": {
      "title": "My Memos Instance",
      "description": "Personal knowledge base and notes"
    }
  }'
```

These settings affect the `<title>` and `<description>` elements in the RSS channel.

## Example: Subscribe to User Feed

### Using curl

```bash
curl https://your-memos.com/u/steven/rss.xml
```

### Using RSS Readers

**Feedly, Inoreader, NewsBlur, etc.:**

1. Copy the feed URL: `https://your-memos.com/u/steven/rss.xml`
2. Add to your RSS reader
3. The reader will poll the feed periodically for updates

**Self-hosted readers (Miniflux, FreshRSS, etc.):**

Add the feed URL to your reader's subscription list.

## Implementation Details

### Feed Generation Process

Source: `server/router/rss/rss.go`

1. **Fetch memos**: Query database for public memos (max 100)
2. **Batch load resources**: Fetch all attachments and creators in bulk to avoid N+1 queries
3. **Generate items**: Convert each memo to RSS item with title, content, author
4. **Add enclosures**: Include first attachment as enclosure
5. **Render XML**: Use gorilla/feeds to generate RSS 2.0 XML
6. **Cache result**: Store in memory cache with ETag
7. **Return response**: Send with cache headers

### Performance Optimizations

- Batch loading of attachments prevents N+1 query problems
- Batch loading of user information reduces database round-trips
- In-memory caching reduces repeated rendering
- ETag support allows RSS readers to skip unchanged feeds
- Cache-Control headers enable CDN and browser caching

## Use Cases

### Personal Knowledge Garden

Share your public notes with others:

```
https://your-memos.com/u/yourname/rss.xml
```

Subscribers can follow your thoughts and learnings in their RSS reader.

### Team Blog

Use the explore feed for a team blog:

```
https://team-memos.com/explore/rss.xml
```

Anyone can subscribe to stay updated with team notes and announcements.

### Read-it-Later Integration

Connect RSS feeds to read-it-later services:

- **Pocket**: Use IFTTT to send new feed items to Pocket
- **Instapaper**: Use Zapier to forward items
- **Wallabag**: Direct RSS subscription

### Aggregate Multiple Users

Create a feed aggregator for multiple Memos users:

```python
import feedparser
import feedgenerator

# Fetch multiple user feeds
feeds = [
    feedparser.parse('https://memos.com/u/alice/rss.xml'),
    feedparser.parse('https://memos.com/u/bob/rss.xml'),
]

# Combine into single feed
fg = feedgenerator.Rss201rev2Feed(
    title="Team Memos",
    link="https://memos.com",
    description="Combined feed from team members"
)

for feed in feeds:
    for entry in feed.entries:
        fg.add_item(
            title=entry.title,
            link=entry.link,
            description=entry.description,
            pubdate=entry.published_parsed
        )

print(fg.writeString('utf-8'))
```

## Limitations

- No authentication support (feeds are public only)
- No filtering by tags or date range
- Maximum 100 items per feed
- No pagination for feeds with many items
- No custom feed formats (Atom, JSON Feed)
- Attachments beyond the first are not included in enclosures
- No support for categories/tags in RSS items

## Troubleshooting

### Feed Shows No Items

**Possible causes:**

1. User has no public memos
2. All memos are set to `PRIVATE` or `PROTECTED` visibility
3. All memos are archived (not `NORMAL` status)

**Solution:**

Ensure at least one memo has:
- Visibility: `PUBLIC`
- Status: `NORMAL` (not archived)

### Feed URL Returns 404

**Possible causes:**

1. Username is incorrect
2. User doesn't exist
3. RSS routes are not registered

**Solution:**

Verify the username by visiting the user's profile page, or use the explore feed instead.

### Images Not Loading

**Possible causes:**

1. Attachment storage is misconfigured
2. Presigned URLs have expired (S3 storage)
3. External references are broken

**Solution:**

Check the attachment URL in the enclosure and verify it's accessible. For S3 storage, presigned URLs are valid for 5 days.
