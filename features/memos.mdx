description: Learn how to create, edit, organize, and manage your memos in Memos
---

Memos are the core unit of content in Memos. This guide covers everything you need to know about creating, editing, and managing your memos.

## Creating a Memo

### Quick Creation

1. Navigate to your **Home** page
2. Find the memo editor at the top of the page
3. Type your content using Markdown formatting
4. Click **Save** or press `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter`

The editor supports:
- Full Markdown syntax (headings, lists, code blocks, etc.)
- Real-time preview
- Auto-save drafts (cached locally)
- Drag-and-drop file uploads

### Editor Components

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Content Editor">
    The main textarea where you write your memo content. It supports:
    - Markdown syntax highlighting
    - Slash commands (type `/` for quick insertions)
    - Tag suggestions (type `#` to see existing tags)
    - Auto-complete for mentions and links
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Toolbar Actions">
    The toolbar provides quick access to:
    - **Insert Menu**: Add links, images, code blocks, and more
    - **Visibility Selector**: Control who can see your memo
    - **Focus Mode**: Distraction-free writing
    - **Location**: Add geographic coordinates to your memo
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Metadata Options">
    Configure additional memo properties:
    - **Display Time**: When the memo appears in your timeline
    - **Pinned Status**: Keep important memos at the top
    - **Tags**: Organize with hashtags like `#work` or `#personal`
    - **Relations**: Link to other memos for context
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Visibility Levels

Control who can access your memos with three visibility options:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Private" icon="lock">
    Only you can see this memo. Perfect for personal notes, drafts, and sensitive information.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Protected" icon="shield">
    Visible to all authenticated users on your instance. Great for team collaboration.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Public" icon="globe">
    Anyone with the link can view, even without logging in. Ideal for sharing knowledge publicly.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
Instance admins can disable public memos through system settings for increased privacy.
</Note>

## Editing Memos

### Inline Editing

1. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon) on any memo
2. Make your changes in the editor
3. Save to update

Changes are tracked with an `update_time` timestamp, and you can view edit history through the API.

### Updating Properties

You can modify memo properties without editing content:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Visibility">
    Change visibility at any time by clicking the visibility icon and selecting a new level.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Pinned Status">
    Click the pin icon to toggle. Pinned memos always appear first in your timeline.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Display Time">
    Edit the display time to reorganize your timeline chronologically.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Organizing Memos

### Using Tags

Tags help categorize and filter your memos:

```markdown
Working on the new #feature for #project-alpha today.
Need to discuss with #team tomorrow.
```

Tags are:
- Automatically extracted from content
- Case-sensitive (`#Work` and `#work` are different)
- Support hyphens, underscores, and Unicode characters
- Clickable for instant filtering

### Pinning Important Memos

Pin memos to keep them at the top of your timeline:

1. Click the **pin icon** on any memo
2. Pinned memos display with a pin indicator
3. They always appear first, regardless of date

### Archiving

Archive old memos to declutter your main timeline:

1. Click the **More** menu (three dots) on a memo
2. Select **Archive**
3. Access archived memos from the **Archived** page
4. Restore by unarchiving when needed

## Memo Properties

Memos automatically track several properties:

| Property | Description | API Field |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Has Links | Contains markdown links | `property.has_link` |
| Has Code | Contains code blocks or inline code | `property.has_code` |
| Has Tasks | Contains task list items | `property.has_task_list` |
| Has Incomplete Tasks | Has unchecked tasks | `property.has_incomplete_tasks` |

These properties enable powerful filtering:

```
# Filter memos with incomplete tasks
property.has_incomplete_tasks == true

# Find all memos with code snippets
property.has_code == true
```

## Comments and Reactions

### Adding Comments

1. Open a memo detail page
2. Click **Write a comment**
3. Type your comment and save
4. Comments appear below the main memo

Comments are full memos with a special parent relationship. They support all memo features including attachments and formatting.

### Adding Reactions

React to memos with emoji:

1. Click the **reaction picker** (smiley icon)
2. Select an emoji (e.g., 👍, ❤️, 😄)
3. Your reaction appears with others'
4. Click your reaction again to remove it

Reactions are tracked per user and display with reaction counts.

## Inbox and Notifications

Stay up-to-date with memo activity through the Inbox feature.

### Viewing Notifications

1. Click the **Inbox** icon in the navigation
2. View all notifications in one place
3. Filter by status: All, Unread, or Archived

### Notification Types

The inbox shows important activities:

- **Comments** - When someone comments on your memo
- **Mentions** - When you're mentioned in a memo
- **Reactions** - When someone reacts to your memo

### Managing Notifications

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Mark as Read">
    Click on a notification to mark it as read. Unread notifications appear with a badge indicator.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Archive">
    Archive notifications you've addressed to keep your inbox clean. Archived items can be viewed via the "Archived" filter.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Notification Count">
    The inbox icon displays an unread count badge so you never miss important updates.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
Notifications are stored per user and automatically generated when memo interactions occur.
</Info>

## Deleting Memos

<Warning>
Deleting a memo is permanent and cannot be undone.
</Warning>

To delete a memo:

1. Click the **More** menu (three dots)
2. Select **Delete**
3. Confirm the deletion

When you delete a memo:
- All comments are also deleted
- Reactions are removed
- Attachments remain in storage (can be deleted separately)
- Relations to other memos are cleared

## API Integration

Create and manage memos programmatically:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://your-instance.com/api/v1/memos \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "memo": {
      "content": "My new memo with #tags",
      "visibility": "PRIVATE"
    }
  }'
```

```javascript JavaScript
import { createPromiseClient } from "@connectrpc/connect";
import { createConnectTransport } from "@connectrpc/connect-web";
import { MemoService } from "./gen/api/v1/memo_service_pb";

const transport = createConnectTransport({
  baseUrl: "https://your-instance.com",
  credentials: "include",
});

const client = createPromiseClient(MemoService, transport);

const memo = await client.createMemo({
  memo: {
    content: "My new memo with #tags",
    visibility: "PRIVATE",
  },
});
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://your-instance.com/api/v1/memos",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"},
    json={
        "memo": {
            "content": "My new memo with #tags",
            "visibility": "PRIVATE"
        }
    }
)

memo = response.json()
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Organizing with Tags">
    - Use consistent tag naming (e.g., `#meeting-notes` vs `#meeting_notes`)
    - Create a tag hierarchy with slashes: `#work/project/feature`
    - Limit tags to 3-5 per memo for clarity
    - Review and consolidate duplicate tags periodically
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Writing Effective Memos">
    - Start with a clear headline or summary
    - Use headings to structure longer memos
    - Add context with links to related memos
    - Include timestamps for time-sensitive information
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance Tips">
    - Keep individual memos under 10,000 characters
    - Use attachments for large files instead of embedding
    - Archive old memos to improve timeline load times
    - Limit real-time collaboration to avoid conflicts
  </Accordion>
