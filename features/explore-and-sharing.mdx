Memos provides powerful discovery and sharing features to help you explore public content and share your knowledge with others.

## Explore Page

The Explore page is your gateway to discovering public memos across your instance.

### What's in Explore

  <Card title="Public Memos" icon="globe">
    All memos marked as **Public** visibility appear in Explore, accessible without authentication.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Protected Memos" icon="shield">
    If you're logged in, you also see **Protected** memos from other users.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Access levels:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Visitors (Not Logged In)">
    - See **Public** memos only

### Filtering Explore

Use the same powerful filters as your personal memos:

```cel
# Find tutorials
tag_search == "tutorial" || tag_search == "howto"

# Find code snippets
property.has_code == true

# Find recent public posts
visibility == "PUBLIC" && create_time > timestamp("2024-01-01T00:00:00Z")

# Find posts with resources
property.has_link == true && tag_search == "resources"
```

<Note>
Shortcuts are not available in Explore view - they're personal to your Home page.
</Note>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Changing Visibility

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Memo">
    Navigate to the memo you want to share.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Visibility Icon">
    Click the visibility icon (lock, shield, or globe) in the memo header.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select New Level">

## API Integration

### List Public Memos

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
const response = await client.listMemos({
  filter: 'visibility == "PUBLIC"',
  orderBy: "display_time desc",
  pageSize: 50,
});

for (const memo of response.memos) {
  console.log(`${memo.creator}: ${memo.content}`);
}
```

```bash cURL
curl "https://your-instance.com/api/v1/memos?filter=visibility%3D%3D%22PUBLIC%22" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"

# No authentication required for public memos
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://your-instance.com/api/v1/memos",
    params={
        "filter": 'visibility == "PUBLIC"',
        "pageSize": 50
    }
)

memos = response.json()["memos"]
for memo in memos:
    print(f"{memo['creator']}: {memo['content']}")
```
</CodeGroup>

### Change Memo Visibility

```javascript
import { create } from "@bufbuild/protobuf";
import { FieldMaskSchema } from "@bufbuild/protobuf/wkt";

// Make memo public
await client.updateMemo({
  memo: {
    name: "memos/abc-123",
    visibility: "PUBLIC",
  },
  updateMask: create(FieldMaskSchema, {
    paths: ["visibility"],
  }),
});
```

### Get User's Public Memos

```javascript
const response = await client.listMemos({
  filter: 'creator_id == 123 && visibility == "PUBLIC"',
  orderBy: "display_time desc",
});

console.log(`${response.memos.length} public memos from user 123`);
```

## Privacy & Security

### What's Shared

When you make a memo public:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Included" icon="check">
    - Memo content (Markdown)
    - Attachments and images
    - Tags
    - Creation/update timestamps
    - Your username and avatar
    - Comments and reactions
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Not Included" icon="x">
    - Private metadata
    - Edit history (not exposed)
    - IP addresses
    - Email or personal info
    - Other private/protected memos
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Privacy Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review Before Publishing">
    - Check for sensitive information
    - Remove personal details
    - Verify attachments are appropriate
    - Review embedded links
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Attachment Privacy">
    - Images have EXIF data automatically stripped
    - File metadata is removed
    - Check filenames for sensitive info
    - Compress or redact screenshots
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Control Your Data">
    - Use Private for drafts
    - Use Protected for internal sharing
    - Only use Public when ready
    - You can revert to Private anytime
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Instance Settings">
    Some instances disable public memos entirely:
    
    ```yaml
    memo_related_setting:
      disallow_public_visibility: true
    ```
    
    Check with your admin if Public is unavailable.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Disabling Public Memos

### Instance-Wide

Admins can disable public visibility:

1. Go to **Admin Settings**
2. Navigate to **Memo Settings**
3. Enable **Disable Public Memos**
4. All existing public memos become protected
5. Users cannot create new public memos

### Per-User

Users can keep all memos private:

1. Don't create public memos
2. Set default visibility to Private in settings
3. Review existing memos and change to Private
